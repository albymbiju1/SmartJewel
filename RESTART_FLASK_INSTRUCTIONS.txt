Great! I can see the issue. Let me check your Flask terminal output:

**The Flask server started successfully**, but it may not have picked up the new `booking_routes.py` file because it was created after the server started.

**Solution: Restart the Flask server**

1. Stop the Flask server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
2. Start it again: `flask run`

This will load the new booking routes blueprint.

**To verify it worked, you should see:**
- No import errors
- MongoDB connected successfully
- The server running on port 5000

Once restarted, try the booking flow again!
